Compicc

    The Compiz ICC colour server, or short compicc, lets you colour manage your
    whole desktop at once and in hardware. Play movies, watch images on wide or
    narrow gamut displays. Each connected monitor is colour corrected for its
    own.

Internet:
    git:  git://compicc.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/compicc/compicc (read-only)


Dependencies:
    Compiz
    Oyranos colour management system

  Debian:
    locales
    build-essential
    libxml2-dev (if you want xml importing/exporting)

    pkg-config
    x11proto-xext-dev
    libxxf86vm-dev
    libxrandr-dev
    libxinerama-dev
    oyranos-0.1.10 +

  Fedora:
    compiz-devel
    (nouveau might need mesa-dri-drivers-experimental)

  openSUSE:
    (nouveau might need http://software.opensuse.org/search?q=Mesa-nouveau3d)

Building:
    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ make install

    for a local build use:
    $ ./configure --plugindir=$HOME/.compiz/plugins --icondir=$HOME/.local/share/icons --regdir=$HOME/.compiz/metadata
    While that is nice for testing, For a regular installation compiz needs to
    see its plugins at starttime, typical registred with system wide ldconfig.


Usage:
    Advanced settiging can be activated by setting a root window
    Atom called _NET_COLOR_DISPLAY_ADVANCED to "1". 
    Setting to "0" will nethertheless update the colour transformations in 
    CompICC.
  Example:
    $ xprop -root -format _NET_COLOR_DISPLAY_ADVANCED 8s -set _NET_COLOR_DISPLAY_ADVANCED  1

    The desktop colour server can apply proofing and out of gamut marking
    to the whole desktop, except the early colour bind regions, by activating
    the _NET_COLOR_DISPLAY_ADVANCED atom. This is an very specialised feature. 
    Applications can be synchronised by the Oyranos settings.
