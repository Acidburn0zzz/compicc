Compicc

    The Compiz ICC colour server, or short compicc, lets you colour manage your
    whole desktop at once and in hardware. Play movies, watch images on wide or
    narrow gamut displays. Each connected monitor is colour corrected for its
    own.

Internet:
    git:  git://compicc.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/compicc/compicc (read-only)


Dependencies:
    Compiz
    Oyranos colour management system

  Debian:
    locales
    build-essential
    libxml2-dev (if you want xml importing/exporting)

    pkg-config
    x11proto-xext-dev
    libxxf86vm-dev
    libxrandr-dev
    libxinerama-dev
    oyranos-0.1.10 +
    doxygen
    libxfixes-dev

  Fedora:
    compiz-devel
    (nouveau might need mesa-dri-drivers-experimental)

  openSUSE:
    (nouveau might need http://software.opensuse.org/search?q=Mesa-nouveau3d)

Building:
    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ make install

    for a local build use:
    $ ./configure --plugindir=$HOME/.compiz/plugins --icondir=$HOME/.local/share/icons --regdir=$HOME/.compiz/metadata
    While that is nice for testing, For a regular installation compiz needs to
    see its plugins at starttime, typical registred with system wide ldconfig.

Install:
    The plugin is a library und should be in your library path during compiz
    start. For tests the following might be enough, after substituting the path:
    $ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/my/libs compiz --replace ccp
    For normal start I found placing the used path in the system library path 
    the most relyable way. After substituting the paths name run as root:
    $ echo /path/to/my/libs > /etc/ld.so.conf.d/my_libs.conf
    $ ldconfig
    The Oyranos and other libraries must be made visible to the library loader
    in the same way.

Usage:
    Use ccsm to switch the plugin on. Its named Colour Management, but might be
    translated according to your locale settings..
    Advanced settiging can be activated by setting a root window
    Atom called _NET_COLOR_DISPLAY_ADVANCED to "1". 
    Setting to "0" will nethertheless update the colour transformations in 
    CompICC.
  Example:
    $ xprop -root -format _NET_COLOR_DISPLAY_ADVANCED 8s -set _NET_COLOR_DISPLAY_ADVANCED  1

    The desktop colour server can apply proofing and out of gamut marking
    to the whole desktop, except the early colour bind regions, by activating
    the _NET_COLOR_DISPLAY_ADVANCED atom. This is an very specialised feature. 
    Applications can be synchronised by the Oyranos settings.

Trouble:
    If the plugin is not visible in ccsm, make shure the icon and 
    registration file is visible to compiz' configuration manager.

    If its clear that the compicc plugin does not run after switching on or 
    crashes, look in the $HOME/.xsession-errors or similiar named log file.

    If CompIcc runs, but you are not shure if it works, then
    a good idea is to use qcmsevents or xprop to look for the
    _NET_COLOR_DESKTOP atom. It should be present on the root window.
    $ xprop -root | grep _NET_COLOR_DESKTOP
    A false colour profile is good for clear diagnostic:
    $ wget http://www.oyranos.org/wiki/images/c/c0/FakeBRG.icc
    $ mv -v FakeBRG.icc ~/.local/shared/color/icc
    $ oyranos-monitor FakeBRG.icc
    As a result the monitor should swap colours.
